{"name":"AutosuJSt","tagline":"An autosuggest control on steroids","body":"## Introduction\r\nI love challenges. Soon after I started working at a new company my PM expressed his wish for a particularly intricate feature to be included in the web application we were developing. This feature basically consisted in a JavaScript autosuggest control on steroids, which instantly got me excited since it seemed like a really cool tool to [try to] implement (actually what my PM was wishing for was some sort of Visual Studio's IntelliSense, and therefore I had to lower his expectations about it). \r\n\r\n## Challenge accepted\r\n\"Oh c'mon, yet another autosuggest control? That is nothing new in the JS world!\" I hear you say. You're right, there are dozens of really cool tools already implemented out there, such as jQuery's own [Autocomplete](http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/), [typeahead.js](https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/), or [select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/), to mention just a few. \r\n\r\n//TODO: what's missing?\r\n\r\nSo I started looking at the peak of the mountain, wondering where the heck I could start climbing it from. I turned to Google for some inspiration to get me rolling and I found exactly what I needed. I could not believe my eyes, it was JavaScript genius [Nicholas C. Zakas](http://www.nczonline.net/) coming to my rescue, again!\r\n\r\nBack in 2003 Mr. Zakas published a great article on [how to create an autosuggest Textbox with JavaScript](http://oak.cs.ucla.edu/cs144/projects/javascript/suggest1.html), followed up by parts [2](http://oak.cs.ucla.edu/cs144/projects/javascript/suggest2.html) and [3](http://oak.cs.ucla.edu/cs144/projects/javascript/suggest3.html).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
